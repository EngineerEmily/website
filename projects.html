					<p>MV Access was created to provide broader access to the agendas and staff reports for the newly created Rental Housing Committee. It is imperiative that the committee runs transparently and all the stakeholders are able to easily get information about the implementation of the Community Stabilization and Fair Rent Act (CSFRA). However, since staff time and resources are limited, I created a website where the public can read the agendas easily on thier phone and in a number of different languages. <a href="https://engineeremily.github.io/MVAccess/">View project</a>.</p>

					<p>During the general election in 2016, I served as the campaign manager for a local city council race. Mountain View had a voluntary expenditure limit that candidates traditionally adhered to, so we needed to bring down costs of the campaign as much as possible. We also wanted to have an open and transparent campaign. One of the features of having a Github website was that we allowed people to "fork" and "pull request" any changes. One person helped create an <a href="https://www.ramirezforcouncil.com/issues">"Issues/Positions"</a> page for the candidate. We also created a <a href="https://www.ramirezforcouncil.com/transparency">"Transparency"</a> page to visulize the donations made to the campaign. <a href="https://github.com/RamirezforCouncil/RamirezforCouncil.github.io" target="_blank">View project</a>.</p>

					<p>Open Data Pledge website developed for the policy team of Code for San Jose to host the open data pledge and which council candidates supported it. Designed to be mobile responsive. The goal was to highlight which candidates supported open data principles. In 2016, the San Jose city council passed an Open Data Policy.<a href="https://codeforsanjose.github.io/opendatapledge/">View Project</a>.</p>
